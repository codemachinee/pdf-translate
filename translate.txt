Science fiction
Science fiction being a genre with a recognizable set of conventions and literary genealogies, in which language often includes neologisms, neosemes,[clarification needed] and invented languages, techno-scientific and pseudoscientific vocabulary,[138] and fictional representation of the translation process,[139][140] the translation of science-fiction texts involves specific concerns.[141] The science-fiction translator tends to acquire specific competences and assume a distinctive publishing and cultural agency.[142][143] As in the case of other mass-fiction genres, this professional specialization and role often is not recognized by publishers and scholars.[144]

Translation of science fiction accounts for the transnational nature of science fiction's repertoire of shared conventions and tropes. After World War II, many European countries were swept by a wave of translations from the English.[145][146] Due to the prominence of English as a source language, the use of pseudonyms and pseudotranslations became common in countries such as Italy[141] and Hungary,[147] and English has often been used as a vehicular language to translate from languages such as Chinese and Japanese.[148]

More recently, the international market in science-fiction translations has seen an increasing presence of source languages other than English.[148]n use. Similarly, software documentation generally pertains to a particular software, whose appalications are used only by a certain class of users.[149]
